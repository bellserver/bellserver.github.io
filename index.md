## About the BeLL Server Project
The BeLL Server Project targets lowers the barrier to accessing high quality basic education in places with little or no Internet.  The server itself is a low powered/cost server designed to facilitate two way data exchanges between a server on the Internet and a place with intermittent connection or no direct connection to the Internet. Sometimes referred to as a sneakernet and sometimes referred to as Ground Computing, the BeLL server is built for delivering Web Apps from the ground, not from the cloud. The BeLL Server can run on small Linux computers such as the $35 Raspberry Pi or the $45 Beagle Bone Black. The BeLL Server project is an Open Source projects and is the result of the work from dozens of volunteers and a small collection of grants.

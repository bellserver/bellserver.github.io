## About the BeLL Server Project
The BeLL Server Project lowers the barrier to accessing high quality basic education in places with little or no Internet.  The server itself is a low powered/cost server designed to facilitate two way data exchanges between a server on the Internet and a place with intermittent connection or no direct connection to the Internet. Sometimes referred to as a sneakernet and sometimes referred to as Ground Computing, the BeLL server is built for delivering Web Apps from the ground, not from the cloud. The BeLL Server can run on small Linux computers such as the $35 Raspberry Pi or the $45 Beagle Bone Black. The BeLL Server project is an Open Source projects and is the result of the work from dozens of volunteers and a small collection of grants.

# BeLL Versions
## BeLL v1
The first version of the BeLL System was based on the popular content management system known as Drupal.  It was implemented in a pilot program known as Ghana Lite between Open Learning Exchange International and Open Learning Exchange Ghana.

## BeLL v2 
The second iteration of the BeLL focused on gaining sneakernet capabilities, power requirements, and reducing the cost of the server. This was accomplished by using a Raspberry Pi Linux computer as the server and CouchDB as the application stack for the Library.

## BeLL v3
USAID funded the Ghana Reads program and a special Learning Management System was customized for the Ghana experience. The underlying technologies are based on the Raspberry Pi Linux computer and CouchDB.
